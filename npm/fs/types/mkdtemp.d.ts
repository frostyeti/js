 * Creates a new temporary directory in the default directory for temporary

 *
 * This call resolves to the full path to the newly created directory.
 *
 * Multiple programs calling this function simultaneously will create different

 *
 * Requires `allow-write` permission.
 *
 * @example Usage
 * ```ts ignore
 * import { mkdtemp } from "@frostyeti/fs/mkdtemp";
 * const tempDirName0 = await mkdtemp();  // e.g. /tmp/2894ea76
 * const tempDirName1 = await mkdtemp({ prefix: 'my_temp' }); // e.g. /tmp/my_temp339c944d
 * ```
 *
 * @tags allow-write
 *
 * @param options The options specified when creating a temporary directory.
 * @returns A promise that resolves to a path to the temporary directory.
